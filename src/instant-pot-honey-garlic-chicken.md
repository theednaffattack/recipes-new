## NOTES



**Watch the cooking video on this page for step-by-step guide.**

I used a 6-quart Instant Pot.

The Sauce in the recipe equals to 8 tablespoons of liquid content, which is 1/2 cup, the min amount of liquid for Instant Pot.

If you don't have an Instant Pot, you can make this honey garlic chicken in a slow cooker, or on your stove top.

If you use a slow cooker, make sure not to overcook the chicken thighs. Use high heat and cook for 3 hours.

For stove top, just pan-fry the chicken thighs and then add in the Sauce. Simmer on low heat and cook until the chicken meat is tender.

SAVE RECIPE

The flavor of salsa prepared with fresh tomatoes, onions, peppers, garlic, and cilantro is so much different than store-bought salsas and so much better!

After making this recipe, you'll wonder why you ever bought commercial salsas at the grocery store in the first place. Once you go homemade, there's no turning back to store bought. 

If you feel daunted by the thought of [peeling tomatoes](https://www.thespruceeats.com/peel-core-and-seed-tomatoes-3061707), don't be. It's not as complicated as it seems. The easiest way to peel fresh tomatoes is to place them in boiling water for 1 minute and then immerse in ice water for about 2 minutes. The skins will split and easily peel off.

After peeling the tomatoes, the rest of the salsa making takes place in one pan. All of the ingredients are combined, brought to a boil, then simmered for 30 minutes. All you have to do is stir occasionally, then cool and store in the fridge.

In addition to making your own salsa at home, you can also make homemade gluten-free tortilla chips. No need to run to the store when the munchies hit. Simply head to your own kitchen!

## Steps to Make It

1. Gather the ingredients.

2. Bring a large pot of water to boil. Fill a large bowl with water and ice, set aside.

3. [Peel the tomatoes](https://www.thespruceeats.com/peel-core-and-seed-tomatoes-3061707) by making a small "x" shape at the bottom of each tomato. Lower tomatoes one at a time into the boiling water (if you have a wire basket, you can use that, it will make removing the tomatoes easier). Let tomatoes sit in the boiling water for 1 minute. Depending on the size of your pot and ice water, you may have to work in small batches. 

4. Remove tomatoes from the boiling water and immediately place in ice water for about 2 minutes.

   

5. Once tomatoes cool, the skins will split and easily peel off. If some areas are tough to remove, then use your fingers or even a paring knife to coax the skin off.

   

6. Coarsely chop the tomatoes. If you prefer your salsa without seeds, remove the seeds while you are chopping the tomatoes.

   

7. Place all ingredients in a large saucepan and bring to a boil.

   

8. Simmer salsa for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

   

9. Cool and pour salsa into three 1-pint jars. Store in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

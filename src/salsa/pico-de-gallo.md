# Pico de Gallo

## Ingredients

- 2 to 3 medium fresh tomatoes (1 to 1 1/2 pounds), stems removed
- 1/2 medium red onion
- 2 serrano or 1 jalapeño pepper, stems, ribs, and seeds removed (less or more to taste)
- Juice of 1 lime
- 1/2 cup chopped cilantro
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch dried oregano (crumble in your fingers before adding), or more to taste
- 1 pinch ground cumin, or more to taste

## Directions

1. Roughly chop the tomatoes, chili peppers, and onions. Be careful while handling the chili peppers. Use a plastic baggie or disposable gloves to handle them, or wash your hands thoroughly with soap and hot water after handling and avoid touching your eyes for several hours. Set aside some of the seeds from the peppers. If the salsa isn't hot enough, you can add a few for more heat.

2. Place all of the ingredients in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade. Pulse only a few times, just enough to finely dice the ingredients and not enough to purée. If you don't have a food processor, you can finely dice by hand.

3. Place in a serving bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste. If the chilis make the salsa too hot, add some more chopped tomato. If it's not hot enough, carefully add a few of the seeds from the chilis, or add a little more ground cumin. If you like, let the salsa sit for an hour (room temperature or chilled) for the flavors to combine.

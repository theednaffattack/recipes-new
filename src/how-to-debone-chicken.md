I have many [chicken recipes](https://rasamalaysia.com/tag/chicken/) that call for deboned chicken thighs, for example: [creamy garlic chicken](https://rasamalaysia.com/creamy-garlic-chicken/), [lemon garlic chicken](https://rasamalaysia.com/lemon-garlic-chicken/), [honey dijon garlic chicken](https://rasamalaysia.com/honey-dijon-garlic-chicken/), [buttery garlic Parmesan chicken](https://rasamalaysia.com/buttery-garlic-parmesan-chicken/), [Vietnamese caramel chicken](https://rasamalaysia.com/vietnamese-caramel-chicken/), [chili lime chicken](https://rasamalaysia.com/chili-lime-chicken/), chipotle lime chicken, etc.

Many readers emailed and asked me how to debone chicken thighs and I thought this post will be handy for those of you who wish to cook with chicken thighs but don’t want the bones, but wish to keep the skin on.

I have even created a video teaching you how to debone chicken thighs.

It’s really very simple and takes only a few steps.

Practice makes perfect and having a sharp knife really helps with deboning the chicken thighs.

Our family loves deboned chicken thighs especially little G.

You get the best of the chicken—with skin on, moist, juicy and tender meat (unlike chicken breast which is dryer), and no bones.

   Brilliant! Just brilliant!
   I have long been a fan of the chicken thigh, but not necessarily the bone.
   NOW I can be rid of the bone AND have an easy to manage “protein package” that will make for nicer presentation!
   Thank you so very much!

     This is a great video. I have a tip; keep the bones in a bag in the freezer. When you have enough use them to make stock for soup.

# Hoagie Bread

from: https://www.thekitchenwhisperer.net/2012/07/02/super-soft-n-chewy-hoagie-rolls/

## Hoagie Roll Ingredient List

- **Bread Flour** – it must be at least 11-14% protein content
- **Yeast –** Active Dry or Instant
- **Water**
- **Salt**
- **Butter**
- **Sugar**
- Items for a bread wash *optional

Directions

1. To the bowl of a stand mixer add in the yeast and sugar. Allow to proof for 5-10 minutes.
2. Next, add in a few cups of flour and the rest of the water. You never add in all of the flour at once as it can fly out everywhere when you turn the mixer on and it may not combine correctly. You want to mix on low until it just starts to combine. Slowly you’ll add a little more flour and salt as it mixes. This can take about 5 minutes or so.
3. Now, depending on the temp in the kitchen or how humid it is, you can add anywhere from 3 1/2 – 4 cups of flour. Just go slow. The worst thing you can do is add too much flour because you’re impatient.
4. At this point, your dough should start to look and feel “Slack”

### Ingredients

- 3 1/2 – 4 cups bread flour/448-512 grams
- 1 1/4 cups plus 2 Tbl – 1 1/2 cups warm water (110-115F degrees) / 308-355 grams
- 2 Tbl sugar
- 1 packet instant yeast (2 1/4 tsp of RedStar Platinum Yeast)
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 4 Tbl cold butter, cubed

### Instructions

#### Using Active Dry Yeast? Start here

1. If using Active Dry Yeast (not the Instant I use) you have to proof the yeast first. Add the Active Dry Yeast, sugar and 1/4 cup plus 2 Tbl warm water in a bowl of a stand mixer.
2. Using a whisk or spoon, mix and set aside for 5-10 minutes or until the yeast has bubbled quite a bit.
3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook (this would be the same bowl your yeast mixture is in) add in 2 cups of flour and remaining cup of water. Start off on low. Mix for 4 minutes.
4. Go to Step 1 of **Recipe Continuation** and follow the rest of the recipe

#### Using Instant Yeast? Start here

1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook add in 2 cups of flour, water, sugar, and Instant Yeast. Start off on low. Mix for 4 minutes.
2. Go to Step 1 of **Recipe Continuation** and follow the rest of the recipe.

#### Recipe Continuation

1. Add in the salt and 1 cup at a time of the remaining flour and mix for 5-6 minutes until the dough is slack (See note). At this point, your mixer should be at medium speed. If your dough, after 5-6 minutes is not slack add in a bit more water (2-4 Tbl). The additional water will fully depend on how humid your room is.
2. Add in the butter 1 Tbl at a time and mix until almost fully melded in before adding the next Tbl.  In total, mix for 1-3 minutes or until the dough comes back together. Remove from bowl and transfer to a greased, covered bowl until doubled in size. ~1 hour.
3. Punch the dough down and place on a very lightly floured board. Divide into 4-8 pieces and shape. I would advise using as little flour as possible when shaping these. The more flour you add, the tougher the hoagies will be. Transfer to a parchment lined tray and cover with lightly sprayed plastic wrap. Allow to rise again until almost doubled. ~30-45 minutes. Do NOT overproof them otherwise they will fall flat.
4. Preheat oven to 375 F. If you want to slash your bread, using a [**lame**](https://amzn.to/3eUSmTk), make your slashes. If desired, brush with coating of choice and bake for 16-23 minutes or until golden brown. To ensure doneness, test the internal bread temp. It should be at 200F.
5. Allow to cool before cutting with a quality bread knife ([ Sani-Safe S162-8SC-PCP 8″ Scalloped Bread Knife with Polypropylene Handle Pan ](http://astore.amazon.com/thekitcwhis-20/detail/B004NG98X2))

### Notes

#### Water

Depending on the type of bread flour as well as how humid your kitchen in you may need to increase the water to 1 1/2 cups (which is only another 2 Tbl more than originally). At times I’ve had to actually go up to 1 3/4 cups total but that was due to how humid my house was at the time.

#### Slack Dough

Slack dough means when then dough cannot hold a shape; it has no elasticity or spring back at all. It’s wet dough but not too wet. It’s “billowy”. The dough is super, super soft and smooth.

#### Equipment

I would HIGHLY recommend using a quality bread knife to slice these as the rolls are soft and chewy and nothing is worse when cutting into them with a crappy knife! You’ll love this knife! [Sani-Safe S162-8SC-PCP 8″ Scalloped Bread Knife with Polypropylene Handle Pan](https://amzn.to/2REmkAh)

#### Coating your bread

- Whole egg: this will give your bread a sheen and color
- Egg Yolk: this will give your bread color and will help brown it
- Egg White: Will give you a firmer crust
- Milk: will give your crust color
- Butter: will make your crust softer and richer

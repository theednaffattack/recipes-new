### INGREDIENTS US CustomaryMetric 1x2x3x

- 1 cup [hulled sesame seeds](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008OGCZPA?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B008OGCZPA&linkCode=xm2&tag=thedargou09-20&th=1)
- 3 tablespoons or more extra virgin olive oil ,see Note (see also blog post about why olive oil is added)

### INSTRUCTIONS 

- Heat a clean, dry cast iron or heavy duty skillet over medium high heat and add the sesame seeds. Stir frequently until they begin to turn golden brown and then stir constantly. Be careful, sesame seeds burn very easily.
- Once they're toasted, let them cool a few minutes then add them to a food processor.
- Start by adding 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Process the mixture into a paste, scraping down the sides. Add more olive oil until you reach the desired consistency (*see Note)
- Makes a little less than 3/4 cup tahini paste, depending on how much olive oil you use.
- Store the tahini in an airtight jar in the fridge and it will last for several months. Stir it throughly before you put it in the fridge because once it's chilled it's difficult to stir. 

### NOTES

\* The texture may be slightly gritty, which isn't a problem, you won't notice it at all when you use it to make hummus for example. But if you want it a little smoother you can run it again through a high-powered food blender (I used my Vitamix).

\* Instead of olive oil you can also use sesame oil, but olive oil is traditional. (Use raw sesame oil, not toasted, or the tahini will have an overpowering "Chinese food" flavor.)

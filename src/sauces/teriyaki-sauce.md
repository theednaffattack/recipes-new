### NOTES

**[Mirin](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019JRIN8?ie=UTF8&tag=thedargou09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B0019JRIN8&th=1)** is a sweet Japanese rice wine, similar to sake but with a lower alcohol content and higher sugar content. If you don't have mirin, you can use sherry with a pinch of sugar added to it.

NOTE: If using as a marinade omit the cornstarch and let the sauce cool completely before using.

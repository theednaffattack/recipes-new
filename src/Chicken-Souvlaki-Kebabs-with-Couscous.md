## Directions

Instructions Checklist

- **Step 1**

  Prepare kabobs: Place chicken and sliced fennel in a resealable plastic bag set in a shallow dish. For marinade, in a small bowl combine the white wine, lemon juice, oil, garlic, oregano, salt and pepper. Remove 1/4 cup of the marinade and set aside.

- **Step 2**

  Pour the remaining marinade over chicken mixture. Seal bag; turn to coat chicken mixture. Marinate in the refrigerator 1 1/2 hours, turning bag once.

- **Step 3**

  Meanwhile, if using wooden skewers, soak eight 10- to 12-inch skewers in water 30 minutes. Drain chicken, discarding marinade and fennel. Thread chicken, accordion-style, onto skewers.

- **Step 4**

  Grill chicken skewers, covered, over medium-high heat 6 to 8 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink, turning once. Remove from grill and brush with the reserved 1/4 cup marinade.

- **Step 5**

  Prepare couscous: In a small saucepan heat 1 teaspoon olive oil over medium heat. Add 1/2 cup Israeli (large pearl) couscous. Cook and stir 4 minutes or until light brown. Add 1 cup water. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, 10 minutes or until couscous is tender and liquid is absorbed, adding 1/2 cup snipped dried tomatoes (not oil-packed) the last 5 minutes; cool. Transfer couscous to a large bowl. Stir in 3/4 cup chopped red sweet pepper, 1/2 cup each chopped cucumber and chopped red onion, 1/3 cup plain fat-free Greek yogurt, 1/4 cup each thinly sliced fresh basil leaves and snipped fresh parsley, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and black pepper.

- **Step 6**

  Serve kabobs with couscous, lemon wedges and, if desired, reserved fennel leaves.

**TOTAL TIME** 1 hour 50 minutes

## INGREDIENTS

- 1/2 cup warm water

I love garlic bread, especially those warm-off-the-oven, garlicky, buttery, aromatic pull apart garlic bread that I can just easily tear off and munch away.

While I like the regular loaf of garlic bread, sometimes it’s kind of a hassle as I need to slice the garlic bread before eating.

So the pull apart garlic bread works just great for me, as I can just tear it off and eat the bread whenever I like.

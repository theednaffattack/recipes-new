# Toasted Herb Rice

from: https://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/toasted-herb-rice

## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons butter or margarine

- 1 ¾ cups uncooked converted long-grain rice (we tested with Uncle Ben's)

- 2 (14-ounce) cans chicken broth

- ¼ teaspoon salt

- 6 green onions, chopped

- 1 teaspoon dried basil

- ⅓ cup pine nuts, toasted

- Garnish: fresh basil sprig

## Directions

1. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; add rice, and sauté 4 minutes or until golden brown. Combine sautéed rice, broth, and next 3 ingredients in a 4-quart slow cooker.

2. Cover and cook on HIGH 2 hours or until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender. Stir in pine nuts. Garnish, if desired.

3. Fresh is Best: If you have fresh basil on hand, use 1 tablespoon fresh instead of 1 teaspoon dried basil.

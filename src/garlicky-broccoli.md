### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 450Â°F. Cut the broccoli into bite-sized florets. Cut the stems into diagonal bite-sized pieces. (Peel the broccoli stems first if you want to; I don't bother.) Place in a large bowl.
2. Place the olive oil, rice vinegar, garlic, and salt in a small food processor and process until thick and creamy. (Alternatively, smash the garlic in a mortar and pestle and whisk in a bowl with the other dressing ingredients.) If desired, add a pinch of red pepper flakes.
3. Add the dressing to the broccoli and toss to coat. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and spread in an even layer.
4. Roast until the broccoli is tender and the edges are singed, 12 to 15 minutes. If you desire an extra measure of smokiness, switch the oven to broil, and move the baking sheet up to the highest rack. Broil for 1 to 2 minutes. Serve hot or cold with wedges of lemon.

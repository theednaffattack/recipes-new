## Ingredients

- 2.5 medium potatoes, peeled and cut to 1-inch cubes (Yukon Gold works best)
- 0.5 tbsp oil
  **Breakfast Potato Seasoning**
- 0.25 tsp kosher salt
- 0.25 tsp smoked paprika
- 0.25 tsp garlic powder
- 0.13 tsp black ground pepper
  US Customary - Metric
  Instructions

1. Preheat the air fryer for about 2-3 minutes at 400F degrees. This will give you the crispiest potatoes.

2. Meanwhile, toss the potatoes with breakfast potato seasoning and oil until thoroughly coated.

3. Spray the air fryer basket with a nonstick spray. Add the potatoes and cook for about 15 minutes, stopping and shaking the basket 2-3 times throughout to promote even cooking.

4. Transfer to a plate and serve right away.

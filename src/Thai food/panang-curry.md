### Notes

**Panang Curry Paste:** Although you can make it [from scratch](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/panang-curry-paste-367765), I never have those ingredients so prefer to buy it from [Amazon](https://amzn.to/34M9ows) or a local Asian market. I like the Mae Ploy Brand. 

**Spice level:** The spiciness of this dish will largely depend on the type and amount of curry paste you use. I have found Mae Ploy to be a little spicier than other brands (2 tablespoons is medium spicy).

**Veggies:** This is a great recipe to “clean out your veggie drawer”. Try adding mushrooms, zucchini, bean sprouts, spinach, bamboo shoots or carrots.

**Chicken**: You can substitute the chicken for shrimp or tofu.

**Rice**: White, brown, or jasmine rice are best, or serve curry over zoodles or spaghetti squash. 

**Vegetarian and vegan panang:** Use a vegetarian curry paste (one that doesn't contain fish sauce or shrimp paste) like [this one](https://amzn.to/36V7CL2). Also omit the chicken and fish sauce from the recipe and add additional vegetables of tofu!

**Make ahead and Storing:** This recipe will keep for 5-7 days in the refrigerator (and that makes it a fabulous **MEAL PREP** dish)! For even quicker meal prep, you can cut the chicken and slice the red bell peppers in advance.

**Freezing Instructions:** Panang curry can be frozen for 2-3 months. Allow it to thaw overnight in the refrigerator and reheat on the stove or in the microwave. Cook rice fresh for serving.

  ## Pressure Canning

  If you want to can unpickled vegetables, [soup stocks](https://www.thespruceeats.com/making-and-preserving-soup-stocks-1327436), beans, or any [non-acidic food](https://www.thespruceeats.com/boiling-water-bath-versus-pressure-canning-1327438), you’ve got to use a special piece of equipment called a pressure canner.

  Other foods, including fruit, sweet preserves, and pickles can be safely canned in a [boiling water bath](https://www.thespruceeats.com/guide-to-water-bath-canning-1327461) without special equipment.

  Each [brand of pressure canner](https://www.thespruceeats.com/best-pressure-canners-4136488) is slightly different, and you want to read through the manufacturer’s instructions carefully before using a new pressure canner for the first time. The instructions that follow apply to pressure canning in general. Hopefully, they will demystify the process for you.

  ## Place Rack in Canner & Add Water

  Pressure canners come with a removable rack. Make sure the rack is in the canner before you add water and load the jars. Add the amount of water specified in the manufacturer’s instructions. If no amount is specified, go for a three-inch depth of water. Add even more water if the food will be processed for longer than 40 minutes.

  ## Turn On Heat If Hot Packing Jars

  If the food will be hot when you fill the jars before processing, you can go ahead and turn the heat on under the canner and start heating the water. Do not turn the heat on yet if the food will be cold packed into the jars or the jars could crack when placed in the water.

  ## Fill Jars and Place in Pressure Canner

  Fill clean canning jars, leaving 1/2 to 1-inch headspace. Screw on two-piece canning lids and use a jar lifter to lower the jars into the canner. Hold the jars upright so that the food doesn’t get on the adhesive ring on the inside of the lids. Leave a little space between the jars.

  ## Close Canner and Vent Steam for 10 Minutes

  ![The lid of a pressure canner has a vent or a petcock to allow steam to escape](https://www.thespruceeats.com/thmb/96LaqYpf4aNBNWEt5hX_0cPaCj0=/320x240/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/pressure-sm-56a30dbb5f9b58b7d0d03066.jpg)

  Leda Meredith / The Spruce

  Fasten the pressure canner lid on; how to do this varies depending on which brand you’ve got. Leave the vent pipe or the petcock open. Turn the heat on high if it isn’t already. When steam begins to escape from the vent or petcock vigorously, start timing. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for how long to allow the steam to exhaust. If unspecified, let it go for 10 minutes.

  ## Raise Pressure and Process the Jars of Food

  ![A weighted gauge placed over the vent of a pressure canner lid](https://www.thespruceeats.com/thmb/rVfzSxTpM2LFLwbJvfY3oCZu3Ek=/320x240/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/weighted-gauge-sm-56a30dbb5f9b58b7d0d0306c.jpg)

  Leda Meredith / The Spruce

  Put the weighted gauge on the vent or close the petcock, depending on the [model of canner](https://www.thespruceeats.com/all-american-10-quart-pressure-canner-review-5176291). The pressure will start to go up, which you can see on the dial gauge or tell by when the weighted gauge starts to hiss and jiggle.

  When the pressure specified by the recipe is reached (typically 10 pounds of pressure), begin timing according to the recipe's instructions. Adjust the heat as necessary to maintain that level of pressure for the entire processing time.

  If the pressure ever goes below the specified amount, you have to raise the heat to bring the pressure back up and start the processing time all over again from the beginning. This is not optional—it’s a safety-first thing.

  ## Depressurize the Canner Before Opening

  When the timed processing is done, turn off the heat and let the canner cool down until five minutes after the pressure gauge reads zero. The canner is not only cooling down during this time, but it is also depressurizing.

  Remove the weight from the vent or open the petcock slowly. If there is any hissing sound when you start to do this, then the canner is not fully depressurized. Leave it weighted or closed in that case and give it an additional five minutes of cool down/depressurizing time.

  ## Open Pressure Canner and Carefully Remove Jars

  Leda Meredith / The Spruce

  Carefully open the canner lid. Remove it by lifting the side that is away from your face; a lot of steam will be released, and it could burn you if you open the side closest to you first.

  Remove the jars with a jar lifter, being careful not to tilt them. Place them on a heat-resistant surface where they can remain undisturbed until the jars are completely cooled. After cooling, test the lids to verify that they are sealed. Label and store away from direct light and heat.

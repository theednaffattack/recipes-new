## WHAT ARE LEAF POTATOES?

Leaf potatoes are roasted potatoes by Australian celebrity chef Donna Hay.

The potatoes are sliced thinly and they are arranged piece by piece in a baking sheet. As the potatoes are paper thin, and they do look like leaves, hence the name leaf potatoes.

## THE BEST ROASTED POTATOES FOR HOLIDAYS OR EVERY DAY!

You haven’t tried roasted potatoes until you have tried these crispy leaf potatoes. Believe me!

Imagine layers upon layers of super crispy potatoes that taste like potato chips, seasoned with rosemary, butter and salt. My mouth is watering at the very thought.

The texture is unlike any roasted potatoes I have ever tasted. I personally think that it’s way better than [hasselback potatoes](https://rasamalaysia.com/garlic-butter-hasselback-potatoes/), [smashed potatoes](https://rasamalaysia.com/garlic-pesto-smashed-potatoes/) or [scalloped potatoes](https://rasamalaysia.com/scalloped-potatoes/).

## HOW DO YOU MAKE CRISPY ROASTED POTATOES?

I am going to show you the tips and techniques:

- Use a [Mandoline Slicer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YDO2LG/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rasamala-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B000YDO2LG&linkId=e16c58007f58e2f32be6f4a8f457e139) to slice the potatoes to thin pieces.

- Dab off the moisture on the potato slices with paper towels.
- Arrange the sliced potatoes upright in a baking pan and bake at 400F.

## BUTTER OR DUCK FAT FOR ROASTED POTATOES?

The original recipe by Donna Hay calls for duck fat. Any foodies who have tried duck fat with roasted potatoes will never go back to butter again.

For this recipe, I used butter, but go ahead and use duck fat if you like. Duck fat is supposed to be “healthier” as it has higher percentage of monounsaturated fat, at 55% while butter has only 26%.

## LAYERS UPON LAYERS OF CRISPY GOODNESS!!

Crispy leaf potatoes is an amazing side dish any time of the year. They are perfect for special occasions such as Thanksgiving or Christmas.

The reason is simple: they are very easy to make, with simple ingredients, but the presentation has a wow factor and the taste and texture are absolutely delightful.

Try this recipe, and use duck fat, if you will. Enjoy!

4. Carefully place the potatoes upright, from left to right, in a baking tray (I used a 8x11" baking tray) until the tray is full. Do not pack in the potatoes too tightly, as this impacts the crispiness.

5. Bake for an hour, or until the potatoes are golden and crispy. Garnish with the remaining salt and the rosemary or oregano. Serve immediately.

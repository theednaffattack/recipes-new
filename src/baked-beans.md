*These baked beans are semi-homemade and the perfect blend of sweet, savory and smoky! Topped with delicious bacon, they're sure to be a hit!*

### Ingredients

- ▢10 slices bacon *diced*
- ▢1 yellow onion *finely diced*
- ▢1/2 green bell pepper *finely diced*
- ▢54 oz can pork and beans *or 4 (15.5oz each) cans*
- ▢4 Tbsp ketchup
- ▢1/4 cup molasses
- ▢2/3 cup brown sugar
- ▢1/4 cup cider vinegar
- ▢2 tsp dry mustard

### Instructions

- Cook bacon about half way through (in whichever way you want), and set aside to drain on a paper towel. Once cooled, roughly chop into semi-bite sized pieces.
- Preheat oven to 325 degrees and set rack to the lower-middle rack position.
- In a deep skillet, heat about 2 Tbsp of bacon grease (or butter) over MED heat. Add diced onion and green pepper and saute about 5 minutes, until softened.
- Add remaining ingredients and stir to combine well. Let mixture simmer for a minute or so.
- While the mixture is simmering, grease a 13x9 baking dish, or other 3 quart dish or pot.
- Pour beans into the prepared baking dish and lay cooked bacon on top of the beans.
- Bake for 2-3 hours, depending on your desired consistency.
- Let the beans stand for 5 minutes before serving.

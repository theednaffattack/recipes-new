Recipes used with this marinade:

- [Grilled Chicken Burrito Bowls](https://suebeehomemaker.com/grilled-chicken-burrito-bowls/). That meal we make TOO often, according to our youngest son. Poor kid. He never gets a variety of meal choices in my kitchen. ðŸ˜€
- [Flank Steak Fajita Salad](https://suebeehomemaker.com/flank-steak-fajita-salad/). The marinade gives the steak a perfect smoky flavor with a touch of heat. Not too spicy though, I promise.
- We also use it in a variety of meats for a variety of Tex-Mex dishes. If you can wrap it in a tortilla or put it on a chip, it will taste great using the BEST EVER marinade.

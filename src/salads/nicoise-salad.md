### Method

1. Make the vinaigrette:

   In a jar, place the oil, lemon juice or vinegar, shallots, herbs, and mustard. Cover with a lid and shake until well blended. Add salt and pepper to taste.

2. Marinate the onion slices in some of the vinaigrette:

   Place onion slices in a small bowl and sprinkle with 3 tablespoons of the vinaigrette. (The onions soaking in the vinaigrette will help take some of the bite out of them.)

3. Cook the potatoes, cut, and dress with vinaigrette:

   Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with 2 inches of water. Add 1 tablespoon of salt. Heat on high to bring to a boil. Lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes or so, until the potatoes are fork tender. Drain.

   While the potatoes are still warm, cut them into halves or quarters, depending on the size of the potatoes.

   Place them in a bowl and dress them with about 1/4 cup of the vinaigrette.

4. Boil the green beans:

   While the potatoes are cooking, fill a medium sized pot halfway with water, and add 2 teaspoons of salt. Bring to a boil on high heat. Add the green beans to the boiling water.

   Cook until tender but still firm to the bite, about 3 to 5 minutes (more or less, depending on the toughness of the beans).

   Drain and either rinse with cold water to stop the cooking, or shock for half a minute in ice water.

5. Arrange the salad on a bed of lettuce:

   Arrange a bed of lettuce on a serving platter. If using tuna steaks, cut them into 1/2-inch thick slices. Mound tuna in the center of lettuce. Sprinkle the tomatoes and onions around the tuna.

   Arrange the potatoes and green beans in mounds at the edge of the lettuce.

   Arrange hard boiled eggs, olives, and anchovies (if using) in mounds on the lettuce bed.

6. Drizzle everything with the remaining vinaigrette:

   Sprinkle with capers if using.

   Serve immediately. Should be served slightly warm or at room temperature.

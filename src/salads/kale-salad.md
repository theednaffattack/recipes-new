### INGREDIENTS

#### Per salad

- ½ medium bunch kale, preferably the Tuscan/lacinato variety, or several handfuls of your favorite greens
- 1 cup leftover cooked grains (I love [brown rice](https://cookieandkate.com/perfect-brown-rice-recipe/), [wild rice](https://cookieandkate.com/perfect-wild-rice-recipe/), [quinoa](https://cookieandkate.com/perfect-quinoa/), farro or wheat berries…)
- 2 carrots, sliced into long ribbons with a [julienne peeler](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CEWJD/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0000CEWJD&linkCode=as2&tag=cooandkatinst-20&linkId=IOGH7FTKIFC5TQOA) or regular veggie peeler
- 1 radish, thinly sliced and roughly chopped
- 2 tablespoons pepitas (green pumpkin seeds) or sunflower seeds, toasted
- More ideas: halved cherry tomatoes, sliced avocado, chopped bell pepper, whatever else strikes your fancy…

#### Green tahini dressing (yields about ¾ cup, so you’ll have plenty for future salads)

- ⅓ cup olive oil
- ⅓ cup lime juice (about 3 to 4 medium limes)
- Handful of fresh cilantro
- 1 small jalapeño, seeds and membranes removed, roughly chopped
- 2 tablespoons tahini
- 1 ½ teaspoons honey or maple syrup
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 clove garlic, roughly chopped
- ¼ teaspoon fine-grain sea salt, to taste
- Pinch of red pepper flakes, optional for extra heat

### INSTRUCTIONS

1. To prepare the kale (skip this step if you’re using any other kind of fresh green), first use a sharp chef’s knife to remove the center ribs from the kale, then discard the ribs. Chop the kale into small, bite-sized pieces. Then, sprinkle the kale lightly with salt, and massage the kale by scrunching handfuls at a time until the kale is darker in color and fragrant. This step reduces the bitterness in the kale and improves its texture.
2. In a bowl, combine the prepared kale, leftover grains (I like to warm mine a bit in the microwave first), carrot, radishes, toasted pepitas, and/or your toppings of choice.
3. To make the dressing: Combine all of the ingredients in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth, pausing to scrape down the sides as necessary. Taste, and blend in additional salt if the dressing needs a little more oomph. If you’d like spicier dressing, blend in a pinch of red pepper flakes. If the dressing is too bold for your liking, dilute it with a little more olive oil and blend again.
4. Drizzle the green tahini dressing generously over the salad (you’ll still have plenty leftover) and enjoy.

### NOTES

MAKE IT GLUTEN FREE: Be sure to use a gluten-free option like rice or quinoa.

MAKE IT VEGAN: Use maple syrup instead of honey.

STORAGE SUGGESTIONS: This dressing keeps well, refrigerated, for about 1 week.

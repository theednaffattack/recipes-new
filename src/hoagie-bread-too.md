### Ingredients

- ▢742 grams (26.17 oz) bread flour **(see notes section for cups measurement and for baker's percentages)**
- ▢423 grams (14.92 oz) water (room temp/about 70 degrees F)
- ▢15 grams (3.04 tsp) salt
- ▢22 grams (4.46 tsp) sugar
- ▢37 grams (2.5 tbsp) olive oil
- ▢8.4 grams (0.57 tbsp) instant dry yeast

### Instructions

- Add all ingredients to the bowl of a standing mixer **(see blog post for step by step pictures)**
- Mix on low speed for 4 minutes
- Increase speed to medium and continue mixing for 15 additional minutes (target dough temperature is about 80 degrees F
- Portion into 12 balls, cover, and let rest for about 20 to 30 minutes
- Run each ball through a pasta machine or roller OR use a rolling pin to flatten to about ¼ inch thick (about 7 to 9 inches long)
- Roll each piece jelly roll style
- Continue rolling to seal the seam, applying more pressure to ends to form the shape of a hoagie rolls
- Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and place the rolls allowing for about 2 inches of space between
- About 30 minute before the rolls are finished rising, preheat oven to 450 (convection) or 475 (non convection oven)
- Allow to rise for 1 hour (somewhere warm; you can use the oven before you begin preheating (!) – I like to turn the oven light on and add a pan of boiled water)
- Just before baking, slash each roll with a clean razor and then mist with clean water just before loading into oven
- Mist the oven several times with water just after loading bread and quickly close oven door
- Bake each tray in the center of oven for about 15 to 20 minutes (may place the remaining tray in the refrigerator until the first tray is finished baking; don't mist with water until ready to bake)

### Notes

**Baker’s percentages shown in notes (flour 100%, water 57%, yeast 1.15%, salt 2%, sugar 3%, oil 5%)**

- In general, 742 grams of bread flour = about 6 cups.
- To get more accurate cups measurement for bread flour, refer to your flour’s nutrition label which will give you grams/cup of flour. 

- Use high quality, bread flour – this is the main ingredient in your recipe so make sure it’s a good brand
- Use a kitchen scale if you have one. Weighing ingredients is one of the easiest ways to improve your bread baking
- Ensure you are mixing the dough enough initially. This recipe calls for a 20-minute initial mix
- I also recommend weighing out each dough ball after you portion the dough so that each roll is about the same size
- Make sure the rolls rise enough before baking. The rolls should be at least 30 to 50% larger than when they were first shaped
- If you kitchen is cold, place a pot of water on the stove with the tray of rolls next to it to heat things up
- Using a thermometer such as a Thermapen is very helpful to make sure your dough is not too hot or too cold (target dough temp about 80 degrees after mixing)
- Make sure your oven is hot enough – I found the best place to bake these rolls was right in the center rack of the oven
- Don’t forget to mist the rolls with water as well as the oven so you get a bit of oven spring (oven spring is the sudden increase in volume of bread during the first several minutes of baking)

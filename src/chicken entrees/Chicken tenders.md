## INGREDIENTS 

**Chicken Marinade** 

- 1 lb chicken tenders
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise 
- 1 Tbsp Dijon mustard 
- 1 garlic clove

**Breading mixture**

- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp pepper
- 1/2 cup Panko bread crumbs
- 1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese 

**Chick-fil-a sauce**

- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1/2 Tablespoon boiling water
- 1 cup Mayonnaise
- 1/4 cup barbecue sauce
- 1 1/2 tablespoons yellow mustard, and 
- 1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. **For the chicken marinade**:

   Whisk together in a large bowl:

   - 1/4 cup mayonnaise
   - 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, and
   - 1 pressed garlic clove

2. Now go ahead and toss the chicken into the marinade. Then use tongs to evenly coat the chicken in the marinade. Then set the chicken aside for a few minutes or you can even let it marinate in the fridge overnight for more flavor.

3. **The breading:** 

   In a medium sized bowl, add and mix

   - 1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
   - 1/2 cup panko style breadcrumbs, and
   - 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
   -  3/4 teaspoon salt
   - 1/8 teaspoon black pepper. 

4. In the meantime preheat your air fryer to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.

5. Now generously coat chicken tenders in the breading mixture one at a time. And I like to press the crumbs into the chicken as much as possible to really get the most crispness out of these tenders.

6. As you work in batches, place the breaded chicken tenders onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. 

7. Now coat the bottom of your air fryer basket with a quick spray of avocado oil. I recommend using your own oil mister here. Then place about 4 chicken tenders onto the Basket and spray with another light coat of avocado oil.

8.  Cook in the air fryer at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for about 4-5 minutes per side. A good way to know that your chicken is done is by inserting a meat thermometer into the center of the chicken. It should read at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit.

9. **chick-fil-a sauce**: 

   - Add 1/2 tablespoon of boiling water to 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar
   - Stir until the sugar is almost completely dissolved. Then set it aside.
   - In a small bowl add:
     - 1 cup Mayonnaise
     - 1/4 cup barbecue sauce
     - 1 1/2 tablespoons yellow mustard, and 
     - 1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke (you can totally skip the liquid smoke if you prefer not to use it).
     - Then add the sugar syrup and whisk everything together until it is well combined.

    - 1 tablespoon of liquid smoke.

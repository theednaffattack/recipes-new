#### Instructions

- Preheat oven to 425°F.
- Scrub potatoes (do not peel them). Dice into 1” cubes.
- If time allows, soak potatoes in cold water for up to 1 hour. (This removes starch and makes for a fluffier potato). Drain and dry potatoes, if required.
- Toss potatoes, olive oil, herbs, and seasonings
- Place on a baking sheet and bake for 30-35 minutes until browned and tender.

#### Recipe Notes

Use any combination of herbs you'd like. Dry spices/herbs can be substituted, use 1-2 teaspoons dry herbs in place of fresh.

Any kind of potatoes will work in this recipe and peeling potatoes is optional.

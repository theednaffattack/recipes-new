# Phillly Cheesteak

from: https://www.notanothercookingshow.tv/post/how-to-make-a-philly-cheesesteak-at-home

**INGREDIENTS:**

Make 2 Sandwiches

- 1 LB Boneless Ribeye (Look for a lot of marbled fat inside the meat)
- 1 Onion, Diced
- 1-2 tablespoons of Beef Tallow/Beef Fat/Ghee
- 5 Slices of Provolone per sandwich
- 1 Hoagie Roll (The Roll is vital, look for one with a slightly crusted exterior, not too crusty, and a softer interior that will hold up to the grease)
- Salt



**DIRECTIONS:**

1. Toss the steak, uncovered, into the freezer for 30-45 minutes to firm up to make it easier for you to slice thin.
2. Dice the onion into a medium size dice, something bigger enough to be able to get the texture of the onion in the sandwich. Set aside.
3. Once the steak has firmed up, take it out of the fridge and using the thinnest, sharpest knife you have (I used a boning knife), trim off any excess fat. Then, using a sawing motion, slowly and carefully slice as thin as you can. Once you slice the entire ribeye as thin as you can, take a bigger chefâ€™s knife and break the meat a bit more until it looks more like chopped meat. Set aside while you preheat the cast iron pan.
4. Heat up a wide cast iron or stainless steel pan over medium heat. Then add the beef fat. Add the onions, season with salt and cook until the onions are softened and begin to brown and caramelize. Once those are cooked, push them off to one side of the pan, then push that area of the pan off the heat, so the flame is focused on the empty space in the pan. Then add the ribeye. Using a large metal spatula, or a brand new, cleaned paint scraper, start to cook and chop up the meat in the pan. You are just looking to cook the pink out of the meat. Once the pink is just about gone, you can mix in the onions. Onion the onions and the meat have come together for a minute or so, then push the entire mixture back off to one side, then portion out one sandwich worth of meat into the shape of the roll. Then top it with the provolone cheese, then cover the pan with a lid or foil and steam the cheese to melt it into all the knocks and crannies of the meat. Once nicely melted, place your sliced roll over the meat in the pan and let that steam for 30 seconds to a minute. Then work a big burger flipper or spatula under the meat and the bread, and then quickly flip it all into the bread to reveal a perfect Philly cheesesteak at home. Cut in half, top with some ketchup or hot sauce or take it as is.
5. You will be proud of yourself.

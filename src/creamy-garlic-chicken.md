## GARLIC CHICKEN

Garlic Chicken is one of the best and most delicious recipes with pantry ingredients. If you have a lot of garlic, frozen [chicken](https://rasamalaysia.com/chicken-recipes/), chicken broth, plain yogurt (or whipping cream), white wine, etc., you should be making this utterly amazing recipe for dinner!

Combine the ingredients together and you will have the most amazing and absolutely scrumptious creamy garlic chicken.

The recipe is inspired by this [rustic chicken with garlic gravy recipe](http://www.seasonsandsuppers.ca/rustic-chicken-garlic-gravy/), but I used yogurt to make the creamy sauce.

If you don’t have plain yogurt at home, you can certainly use whipping cream.

## BONE-IN OR BONELESS CHICKEN THIGHS?

For the [chicken](https://rasamalaysia.com/chicken-recipes/), I used skin-on and bone-in chicken thighs, but I deboned the thighs.

This will ensure that you get the best of the chicken thighs: moist, tender, crispy on the bottom but not dry, with skin and without bones.

Learn [how to debone chicken thighs](https://rasamalaysia.com/how-to-debone-chicken-thighs/) with my picture guide and video.

This is similar to how I made my [chili lime chicken](https://rasamalaysia.com/chili-lime-chicken/) and [chipotle lime chicken](https://rasamalaysia.com/chipotle-lime-chicken/). That’s the way go to with chicken thighs, trust me on that – deboned and skin-on!

## THIS IS A ONE PAN CHICKEN RECIPE

This is a super easy one skillet chicken recipe. I love using my cast-iron skillet but you can use any pans (stainless steel or non-stick).

I finished the creamy garlic chicken off with 1 minute of broiling in the oven to give the chicken skin little chars, which is an optional step.

This creamy garlic chicken is delightful with some pasta, and they are done in about 20 minutes and you have only one pan to clean. Bon appetit!
